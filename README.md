specificHeat
============

A searchable list of specific heat capacities for my ENE-5A students.

Various materials are uploaded as a .json file. Filters include by name or by specific heat capacities.

Calculator

Also included is a quick heat energy calculator checker. It allows students to quickly double check their work without receiving the correct answer.

Base equation for heat energy is q = mc/deltaT
